# moyaiscript
python but its ðŸ—¿

## usage
1. clone repo or download zip
2. put your code in input.py
3. run `python compiler.py` and press y when prompted
4. your moyaiscript is now ready to be run
5. run `python runner.py` to execute your `script.moyaiscript` file

## disclaimer
this is obviously not a real programming language, all it does is convert python code to moyai and run it

use an utf-8-compatible terminal for the best experience
